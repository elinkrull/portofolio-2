The portofolio is a project where the purpose is to evaluate my own projects. The Portofolio is built using a CSS Bootstrap and React.

## Description

Before submitting this portfolio assignment, I was expected to make improvements to each project I am showcasing by using the detailed feedback provided by my teachers. 

These improvements should include a self-assessment of my performance, and these must be clearly but briefly mentioned in each project page article.
The projects I had to select for this Portofolio was:

- JavaScript Frameworks
- Semester Project 2
- Exam Project 2

## Built With

- HTML
- React
- CSS Bootstrap

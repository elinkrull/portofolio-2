The portofolio is a project where the purpose is to evaluate my own projects. The Portofolio is built using a CSS Bootstrap and React.

## Description

Before submitting this portfolio assignment, I was expected to make improvements to each project I am showcasing by using the detailed feedback provided by my teachers. 

These improvements should include a self-assessment of my performance, and these must be clearly but briefly mentioned in each project page article.
The projects I had to select for this Portofolio was:

- JavaScript Frameworks
- Semester Project 2
- Exam Project 2

## Process

Each project teaser card must include the following:

- The project thumbnail (png or jpeg and optimized to <=200KB).
- The project title.
- The project's short description (2 lines, a teaser of max 120-130 characters).
- The project read more link to the article page OR the entire project card is a link to the article page.

Each project article page must include the following:

- Project article title, detailed description and share/copy link or icon.
- Project article image with caption (png or jpeg and optimized to <=200KB).
- Project link to the live site (must open in a new tab).
- The GitHub repository README.md page link (must open in a new tab).
- Main content (reflections and improvements).

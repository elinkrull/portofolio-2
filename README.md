The portofolio is a project where the purpose was to evaluate my own projects. The Portofolio must be built using a CSS Framework and or JavaScript Framework.

## Description

Before submitting this portfolio assignment, I was expected to make improvements to each project I am showcasing by using the detailed feedback provided by my teachers. 

These improvements should include a self-assessment of my performance, and these must be clearly but briefly mentioned in each project page article.
The projects I had to select for this Portofolio was:

- JavaScript Frameworks
- Semester Project 2
- Exam Project 2

## Built With

- HTML
- React
- CSS Bootstrap

## Contributing

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
